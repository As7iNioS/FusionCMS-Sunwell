/**
 * Note to module developers:
 *     Keeping a module specific language file like this
 *    in this external folder is not a good practise for
 *    portability - I do not advice you to do this for
 *    your own modules since they are non-default.
 *    Instead, simply put your language files in
 *    application/modules/yourModule/language/
 *    You do not need to change any code, the system
 *    will automatically look in that folder too.
